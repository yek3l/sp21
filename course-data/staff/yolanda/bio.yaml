responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I'm from San Ramon, California, which is a 40 min drive southeast of Berkeley. I was initially going to commit to UW, but decided to come to Cal in hope of better opportunities and more favorable weather. I am thankful to have gotten both!

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - After never coding before CS10, I've since learned Snap, Python, Java, SQL, Scheme, HTML/CSS and minimal amounts of JavaScript.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I enjoy drawing, playing the guitar, watching gaming streams, and drinking matcha. When I'm not doing those, you'll often find me reconstructing my Spotify playlists or watching the sunset. 

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - Being able to finish the monthly puzzle loop at https://www.puzzle-loop.com/.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - "Over the summer, I convinced (read: bribed) CS10 students to fill out a feedback survey by promising to do a “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before”-inspired challenge where you send Google forms to all your past crushes with questions like “did you know I liked you?”, “did you like me back?”, and “how awkward is this?”. Perhaps there will be a similar opportunity this semester…"

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Aside from teaching, I'll be taking Stat 135, ISF 100c, IEOR 173, and MCB 110. I’ll also be involved in CS10 course/textbook development and doing research. Outside of school, I'll be running a lot, as well as finding as many ways to annoy my younger brother as possible. Stop by OH/Drop me a message on Discord to say hello anytime! I'd always love to chat.
