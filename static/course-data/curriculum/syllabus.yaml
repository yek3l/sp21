# Ignore for now.

overview:
  - header: Welcome!
    body: In Fall 2020, CS10 is planning to try a new teaching plan to better support students and 
          encourage participation during this unusual online offering of the course. Special thank 
          you to John DeNero and the CS61A team for writing the original document which this was based on.

  - header: Collaboration, not Competition
    body: You are encouraged to form study groups and work together to understand course material, 
          but (unless specified otherwise) all your graded work should be your own. Academic integrity 
          and ethical conduct are of utmost importance in the College of Engineering and at UC Berkeley, 
          especially with online offerings. We want to remind you that this course is graded on an 
          absolute scale – that means that there will be no curve at the end of the course, so you 
          don’t have to feel the pressure of having to cheat to get your A. You’re competing against 
          an absolute scale, and you can all (in theory) receive A+ grades! (Though, we might need to make 
          small bin adjustments if the GPA of the class is below the department suggested range, so we might 
          adjust your score up, but it’ll never be adjusted down).

    subsections:
      - header: Flexibility and Community
        body: Online classes taught during a time of wildfires, power outages, and a worldwide pandemic 
              need to have policies that support students in different living situations, and in different 
              time zones. They need to have a way that the students can get to know each other, learn from 
              each other, and study with each other. They need to have a way the course staff can get to know 
              their students, and (most importantly) check in with them to make sure their health and learning 
              is going ok. The deadlines need to have flexibility in case a student or team needs some more time 
              to finish a project or homework. We believe we have built all of that into our class this semester.

      - header: Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning
        body: Research (and anecdotal evidence) have shown that students who keep up with the material every week 
              do better than students who fall behind, start projects late, and have to cram for each exam at the last 
              minute. So, as much as you can, attend our face-to-face live session (Mon @ 10am PST … but Wed when Monday 
              is a holiday) + a discussion (5 different times) synchronously. However, you will not be penalized for being 
              in a time zone that makes that difficult, and you will find recordings of these sessions available. The only 
              required synchronous element is a weekly 15m check-in with you and three other students with video on (with 
              exceptions on a student-by-student basis), but will have many times throughout the day available for that.
