  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - Oof, I've been everywhere. My childhoods was in ShenZhen, China. Pretty much grew up in New Zealand, and I had half decent grades and an Asian mum, so my lazy butt got booted to the USA for College :D

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - "Not enough, I've only coded for fun and for courses, so there's been a lot of projects. Ne'er the less, I haven't done anything epic so alas, I am not top candidate for big tech companies T_T. For coding languages Snap is forever #1, but I know around 9 other languages to a moderatly proficient level"

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - In the holidays I quite enjoy travelling, hiking, and camping, my most memorable hike was the 3 Passes Route back in NZ (google if you want, it's glorious). Normally though ooohh boy, I loooove gaming, especially with friends <3. League of Legends is my favourite game, so hit me up if you wanna jam :P, but I also play R6 siege, Phasmo, L4D etc... I did Youtube for a bit, that was good fun ^_^, might get back into it in the near future!

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - Uuuhh, I tend to get along with anyone and everyone, but other than that I am a remarkably talentless individual. If it counts for anything, I once had 32 side dishes at an all-you-can-eat hot-pot.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I once flipped an NZ $2 coin and it fell straight through the gaps of my deck.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - ~
